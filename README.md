# Literature-Review-on-Multimodal-Stab-Detection

Conducted a systematic literature review of 45+ papers (25 shortlisted) on violence detection, identifying open challenges in temporal modeling, dataset generalization, and edge deployment.

Experimented with YOLOv8-based models for stab detection, curating and annotating datasets (UCF-Crime, synthetic stabbing scenarios, Open Images) to evaluate accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score using Roboflow.
